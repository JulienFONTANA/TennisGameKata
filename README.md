# Tennis Game Kata

## Rules
This Kata is about implementing a simple tennis game.
The scoring system is rather simple:

1. Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40

2. If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game! 
However there are special rules...

3. If both have 40 the players are deuce. 
	a. If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball. 
	b. If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game 
	c. If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.

## Why C#.NET ?
C# is my main coding language. I wanted to do a bit of TDD to train.
I'd like to keep it as simple as possible, clear, but most importantly 
keep the whole project open to change and modifications !

Besides the standard .NET librairies I will use NUnit and NFluent.
